# LMDFormer

We are organizing the code and will upload it later.

The combination of the CNN-based Lightweight Convolution Module (LCM) and Multi-Dimensional Self-Attention Encoder with the Lightweight Multi-Dimensional Attention (LMDA) Encoder forms the LMDFormer. The two establish a good integration of local and global features. It is designed to seamlessly function as an easily integrable, plug-and-play module within your model architecture.
